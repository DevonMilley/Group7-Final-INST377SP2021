# UMD Dineify
When a student first enters campus, it can be hard to find the foods the student wants or needs to eat. An application helps with this problem by giving a way for students to find their favorite foods at UMD Dining Halls. The dining halls have a diverse variety of food so there is something for everybody. Our application uses Sequelize and Express.js to access and modify data from the UMD Dining Halls SQL database.
